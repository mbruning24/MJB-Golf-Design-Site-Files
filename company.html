	<h1>Michael J. Benkusky, ASGCA</h1>

	<p>Growing up in Marion, IA, Michael Benkusky began his study of golf course architecture early 
	and first hand by working on and playing the Donald Ross designed Cedar Rapids Country Club. 
	In 1983 he entered Iowa State University to study Landscape Architecture with an emphasis in 
	golf design. Benkusky played on the varsity golf team where he was introduced to another of the 
	game's giants, architect Perry Maxwell, who designed Iowa State's home course, Veenker 
	Memorial Golf Course.</p>

	<p>In January 2005, Benkusky started his own design firm, Michael J. Benkusky, Inc. The mission of 
	MJB, Inc. is to combine quality designs with a hands on approach and a close working 
	relationship to enhance his client's golf courses. With over 20 years of golf course design 
	experience he has worked on hundreds of projects including courses originally laid out by 
	Donald Ross, Perry Maxwell, Seth Raynor, Tom Bendelow, and Colt & Allison.</p>

	<p>Michael Benkusky has been a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects 
	since 1997.</p>

    <div class="statement"><p><em>"Thank you for taking the time to review my work. I hope you find my projects interesting, beautiful, 
    and creative.  I look forward to bringing this same creativeness and commitment to your project."</em></p>
    <img src="images/company/sig.png" /></div>
    
    <h1 style="clear:both">Mission Statement</h1>

	<p>Michael J. Benkusky is committed to promoting the game of golf through the design of enjoyable, challenging, 
	and beautiful golf courses while creating, preserving, and enhancing their surrounding environments.</p>

	<p>My goal is to improve the quality of life by producing profitable golf courses that support their owners and their communities.</p>

	<p>Michael J. Benkusky, Inc. is established to provide full scale golf course architectural services including the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>- New golf course design.</li>
		<li>- Site development Master Planning.</li>
		<li>- Existing golf course Master Planning.</li>
		<li>- Classic golf course restoration.</li>
		<li>- Site assessment and feasibility.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>

	<p>My philosophy is to work hand in hand with the client and listen to the clients needs, wishes and wants 
	to create a finished product that will be the center piece of your club or development. I have the capabilities to work as 
	the project leader and bring the team together or work as part of the team with your consultants. No matter how big or 
	small the project I will always work closely with the team to eliminate any miscommunication and make sure your project is a success. 
	I am always budget conscience and will provide unlimited design alternatives to assure that you receive the best final design 
	that maximizes your budget.</p> 

	<p>Golf courses should be aesthetically pleasing, strategically challenging, and fun to play. My courses are visually stimulating 
	punctuated by attractive bunkers, contoured fairways, subtle mounding, and seductive putting greens. Selective placement 
	of natural grasses and artful mowing patterns frame fairway landing areas and provide a visual backdrop to strategically 
	challenging and often guarded putting greens.</p>
