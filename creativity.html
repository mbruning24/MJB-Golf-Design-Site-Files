	<h1>Creativity</h1>

	<p>The joy of being a golf course architect is having the ability to be a creative problem solver.  Usually we are not brought in just to spend 
	the courses money.  We are brought in to help make the course more prosperous.  This may involve changes to reduce costs, such as maintenance.  
	It may be to offer redesign options to upgrade the course and bring in more golfers.  In either case we discuss the goals of the course and put 
	forth a plan that will help achieve that goal.  Here are some ways we do that.</p>

	<h3>Being creative</h3>

	<p>I've been in the golf design business for over 25 years and in the golf business much longer.  I've seen just about every scenario out there 
	and helped courses conquer their problems.  Many times the solution is right there in front of our face.  As easy as moving a bunker, adding a new 
	tee, or softening the slope on a green.  However, at other times in involves more in depth thought.  In either case we put on our thinking caps, 
	talk to our clients, and look at the best possible answer.</p>

	<h3>Being fiscally responsible</h3>

	<p>It's rare that anyone gets an unlimited budget.  We always need to have the little voice tell us if this is the most practical solution.  I 
	treat my clients with the idea that it is my money I'm spending and would it make sense to me.  I'll always look for a way to do things the least 
	expensive way, as long as it does not sacrifice the quality of the work.  The last thing you want to do is save a little money now without knowing 
	that it will cost you more in the future.  I create fiscally responsible plans that discuss all possible options so, together, we can make a sound 
	decision on how to move forward.</p>

	<h3>Alternative construction methods</h3>

	<p>Times have begun to change regarding how to complete your project.  Yes, for many large scale projects most courses bring in an outside 
	contractor to do all the work.  But today's market is driven by smaller projects.  Courses want to complete their work over a given timeframe to 
	spread out the cost.  I work with many courses in this regard.  On some we may bring in a contractor to do part of the work, like shaping a new 
	green.  But then the owner will complete the rest of the work, including drainage and grassing.  I've even worked with a club to train their staff 
	on doing the shaping.  All these techniques help them complete the work within their budget and make their course better.</p>

	<p>These are just a few examples on how to be creative in completing your project.  When it comes to design features, that's where we can define to 
	look of your course.  Check out the photos on this page and how they relate to many design features.  These involve green design, bunker design, 
	and classic course design.  In each I give my philosophy as to what can help create a sound, practical design for your course.<p>
