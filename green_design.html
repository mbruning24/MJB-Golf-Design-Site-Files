	<h1>Green Design</h1>
	<div class="img01"><img src="images/green_design/01_sm.png" /><p>Click to Enlarge Image</p></div>
	<p>Green design involves more then just the putting surface. It extends from the immediate 
	surrounds all the way back to the approach. A proper design will set up the golfer with 
	options, no matter how, or where, they are approaching the green. Proper green design will 
	reward the golfer who challenges the trouble. Introducing bailout areas offer more options, 
	but they also puts doubt in the mind of the golfer about where to hit the shot. They see the 
	bailout area as a safer place and a place to ‘miss’ their shot.  They take their focus off 
	the target, and don’t hit the shot that they wanted. It is this lack of focus that separates 
	the pros from the amateurs.</p>
	<h3>Siting the Green</h3>
	<p>Good green design starts with finding the proper green 
	site. A good architect will review a piece of land and try to locate as many good green 
	sites first and then develop the routing to the golf course. The architect should not pay 
	any attention to how the course flows in terms of yardage and par unless absolutely 
	necessary. It may not be desirable to have multiple holes of the same par playing in 
	succession. However, this rule can always be broken if it leads to a great golf course. 
	Cypress Point, which consistently ranks in the top 5 golf courses in the world, has 
	consecutive par 5's on the front nine and consecutive par 3's on the back nine. This 
	course seems to break all the "rules" of design. Yet, because the course works with the 
	site, it is considered one of the best.</p>
	<h3>Putting Surfaces</h3>
	<p>Developing interesting putting surfaces is completed in the field, not on paper. Designers may start their green design with grading plans or green 
	details, but this is done to provide a starting point for the contractor. Once initial construction has taken place, the architect should spend extra 
	time working with the contractor. Adjusting grades by a few tenths of an inch make all the difference in creating an interesting green.</p>

	<h3>Green Surrounds</h3>
	<p>When developing a green complex, what surrounds the green is just as important as the 
	putting surface.  Whether it be a bunker complex, water hazard, mounding, or grass depression, 
	these features add a great deal to the strategy of the golf hole.<p/>
    <p>If you are designing a new green, starting from scratch, you have the ability to combine 
    putting surface design with the surrounds to create a seamless design.  In a green remodel, 
    many times we keep the existing green contours but look at updating the surrounds.  
    This takes more care to blend the two together so the complex looks like is has always been there.<p/>
    <p>All golfers will rave about a course if it has good green complexes. It may be the difference that 
    brings existing players back and new players to your course.</p>
