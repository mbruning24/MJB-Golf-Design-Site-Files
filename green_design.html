	<h1>Green Design</h1>

	<p>Green design involves more then just the putting surface. It extends from the immediate 
	surrounds all the way back to the approach. A proper design will set up the golfer with 
	options, no matter how, or where, they are approaching the green. A good green design 
	can reward the golfer who challenges the trouble, while giving the golfer a bailout area 
	puts doubt in their mind about where to hit the shot. They see the bailout area as a safer 
	place and take their focus off the target. It is this lack of focus that separates the pros 
	from the amateurs.</p>
	<h3>Siting the Green</h3>
	<p>Good green design starts with finding the proper green 
	site. A good architect will review a piece of land and try to locate as many good green 
	sites first and then develop the routing to the golf course. The architect should not pay 
	any attention to how the course flows in terms of yardage and par unless absolutely 
	necessary. One does not want multiple holes of the same par playing in succession. 
	However, a rule can always be broken if it leads to a great golf course. Cypress Point, 
	which consistently ranks in the top 5 golf courses in the world, has consecutive par 5's 
	on the front nine and consecutive par 3's on the back nine. This course seems to break all 
	the "rules" of design. Finding a great green site is the best way to find a great golf hole.</p>
	<h3>Green Surrounds</h3>
	<p>When developing the green complex, some architects like to work from the putting surface outwards, and some like to work inwards from the surrounds. 
	My approach varies depending on the green site. Finding a great green site will always lead to designing a green from the out going into the putting surface. 
	This is because you have natural contours that you will keep in place and the green will fit within these contours. Minor modifications will be made to make 
	sure the putting surface is playable.</p>
	<div class="img02"><img src="images/green_design/02_sm.png" /><p>Click to Enlarge Image</p></div>
	<p>When you site a green on flat ground, the typical approach will lead to developing the 
	putting surface first and then adding interest to the surrounds as it relates to the entire 
	hole. In a nutshell, when locating the green first, you end up designing from the green 
	back to the tee. In the other scenario you end up design from tee to green. In either 
	case a good designer can create an interesting golf hole.</p>
	<h3>Putting Surface</h3>
	<p>Developing interesting putting surfaces is completed in the field, not on paper. 
	Designers may start their green design with grading plans or green details, but this 
	is done to provide a starting point for the contractor. Once initial construction has 
	taken place, the architect should spend extra time working with the contractor. 
	Many times I'll even jumping on a piece of equipment myself to create the subtle rolls 
	that make a green interesting. All golfers will rave about a course if it has good green 
	complexes. That is what brings players back to play again.</p>
